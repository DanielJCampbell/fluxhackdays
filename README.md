# Flux Hack Days

Every month, Flux Federation allows its employees 2 days to work on projects that might not be directly work related - this repository contains some of the things I've created, primarily for the purpose of teaching myself new languages and tools.


In particular, the projects listed are, in order of creation:
- Sphubes & Squircles - An experiment with WebGL, rasterizing 3d circles & spheres
- Marching Cubes - Following on for the above, implementation of the marching cubes algorithm in WebGL
- Maze - 3D maze generation & (very broken) navigation, WebGL
- Elm Dice Roller - Originally a basic dice roller, slowly turning into a tabletop game sim, mostly an Elm learning exercise


No work has been done outside hackdays - everything is shown as is, with no guarantee that the projects work as intended. All code belongs to Flux under the MIT license.
